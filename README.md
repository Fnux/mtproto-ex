# MTProto-ex

The aim of this project is to implement [MTProto](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) (Telegram) in elixir.

Well, it's still far from completed.

## Actual state

* Able to compute an Authorization key
* Able to send/encrypt && receive/decrypt payloads
* Somewhat able to authenticate.
* Was able to read an incoming message (from another user) in the REPL.

## Example

```
Â» iex -S mix

Interactive Elixir (1.4.0) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex> session_id = MTProto.Session.open()

iex> {:ok, session_id} = MTProto.connect(4) # Connect to DC 4

19:10:07.231 [info]  The authorization key was successfully generated.

iex> MTProto.send_code(session_id, "0041000000000")
{0000000000000000000,
 %{name: "rpc_result", req_msg_id: 0000000000000000000,
   result: %{is_password: %{name: "boolFalse"}, name: "auth.sentCode",
     phone_code_hash: "000000000000000000",
     phone_registered: %{name: "boolTrue"}, send_call_timeout: 120}}}

iex> MTProto.sign_in(session_id, "0041000000000", "00000")
